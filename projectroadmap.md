# Project Road Map ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
✔ Search for possible code to use --> (https://github.com/chintanpanchamia/sociometer/blob/master/Analyzer.py)

✔ Create repository in KSU-IS team --> (https://github.com/ksu-is/Personality-Test)

✔ Create README.md file for respository --> (https://github.com/ksu-is/Personality-Test/blob/master/README.md)

✔ Create projectroadmap.md file for repository --> (https://github.com/ksu-is/Personality-Test/blob/master/projectroadmap.md)

✔ Figure out how to run chosen reference code

- Implement changes to source code that align with project idea (Collaborate with project partner)

- Run final code and fix any bugs or syntax errors

- Finalize code and run

- Look over and update README.md file to ensure it fits/still fits with project

- Submit final code as project
